// This driver encodes the states of the A and B pins of the rotary encoder
// into a 2-bit word and checks the past 4 words of history and the current 1
// word to determine if the rotation was successful and the direction of the
// rotation.
//
// The EC12 compatible rotary encoder operates in the sequence of A connection,
// B connection, A disconnection, B disconnection when rotating clockwise. In
// the counterclockwise direction, the sequence is reversed, becoming B
// connection, A connection, B disconnection, A disconnection. This driver
// assumes that C is connected to GND and A and B are in a pulled-up state.
// Therefore, both A and B are expected to be in a Hi state initially, and to
// become Lo states upon connection and Hi states upon disconnection.
//
// This driver encodes the Hi state as 0 and the Lo state as 1 when encoding
// both pins A and B to a word. It also assigns A to the 0th bit and B to the
// 1st bit. The resulting 2-bit word and the corresponding relationship between
// pins A and B are as shown in the following table.
//
// | Word | B | A |
// |-----:|---|---|
// | 00   |Hi |Hi |
// | 01   |Hi |Lo |
// | 11   |Lo |Lo |
// | 10   |Lo |Hi |
//
// Clockwise rotation of the knob starts with 00 as the initial state and the
// 2-bit word transitions in the order of 01, 11, 10, 00. Counterclockwise
// rotation of the knob starts with 00 as the initial state and the 2-bit word
// transitions in the order of 10, 11, 01, 00.
//
// The past four words of the two-bit word transition history are packed into
// an 8-bit = 1-byte variable in order from the least significant bit using bit
// shift. Clockwise rotation becomes 0x1e (=00, 01, 11, 10), and
// counterclockwise rotation becomes 0x2d (=00, 10, 11, 01). When the latest
// two-bit word is 00, the rotation is judged to be successful or not and the
// direction of the rotation is determined by comparing the variable indicating
// the transition history with the above values.
